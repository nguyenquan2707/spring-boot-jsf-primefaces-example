# Spring-boot + Primefaces (JSF)
As java developers, sometimes we need to create web applications. Because our skills are limited to the back-end side of applications, it`s hard for us to create a web application project. One of the oldest frameworks that help java programmers to build web applications without good knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript is JSF (Java Server Faces).
So I decided to build a raw project based on Spring-boot and Primefaces to help every java developer who needs to build a web application but does not know well HTML, CSS, javascript language, and other client-side frameworks such as React or Angular.
You should know how to work with XML, and if needed to make a pretty user interface, you should learn only CSS.

To execute the project, write this command in the terminal at the root of the project:
```
java -jar target/spring-boot-primefaces-sample-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
after see message that show container started successfuly, you can browes to ```http://localhost:8080/index.xhtml```.
